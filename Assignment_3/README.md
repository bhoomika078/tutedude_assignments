# ASSIGNMENT 3: Functions & Modules in Python

This repository contains my submissions for **Module 4: Functions & Modules in Python**. These programs demonstrate advanced Python concepts, including the definition and application of custom functions, loops or recursion, and the integration of built-in Python modules.

## Task 1: Calculate Factorial Using a Function
This program is designed to compute the factorial of a number through a dedicated function

### Features:
**Function Definition**: Includes a function named factorial that accepts a number as an argument.
**Logic**: Calculates the factorial using either a loop or a recursive approach.
**Return Value**: The function returns the final calculated result
**Output**: Calls the function with a sample number and prints the result to the screen.

### Expected Output:
```text
Enter a number: 5
Factorial of 5 is: 120
```

## Task 2: Using the Math Module for Calculations
This program utilizes Python's built-in math module to perform various scientific calculations.

### Features:
**User Input**: Prompts the user to enter a specific number.
**Math Module Integration**: Uses the math library to perform calculations.
**Calculations**: Automatically determines the square root, natural logarithm (log base e), and sine (in radians) of the input.
**Results**: Displays all calculated values clearly as output.

### Expected Output:
```text
Enter a number: 25
Square root: 5.0
Logarithm: 3.2188758248682006
Sine: -0.13235175009777303
