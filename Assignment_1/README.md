# ASSIGNMENT 1: Basic Python Concepts

[cite_start]This repository contains my submissions for **Module 2: Basic Python Concepts**[cite: 1, 2]. These programs demonstrate fundamental skills in Python, including handling user input, mathematical operations, and string concatenation.

## Task 1: Perform Basic Mathematical Operations
[cite_start]This program takes two numbers as input and performs basic arithmetic[cite: 3, 4].

### Features:
* [cite_start]**User Input**: Takes two numbers from the user[cite: 5].
* [cite_start]**Calculations**: Performs Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division[cite: 6, 7, 8, 9, 10].
* [cite_start]**Results**: Displays the output of each operation on the screen[cite: 11].

### Expected Output:
```text
Enter the first number: 5
Enter the second number: 10

Addition: 15
Subtraction: -5
Multiplication: 50
Division: 0.5


## Task 2: Create a Personalized Greeting
[cite_start]This program is designed to create a custom greeting by processing user names[cite: 3, 4].

### Features:
* [cite_start]**User Input**: Takes the user's first name and last name as separate inputs.[cite: 5].
* [cite_start]**Concatenation**: Combines the first and last name into a single full name[cite: 6, 7, 8, 9, 10].
* [cite_start]**Greeting**: Prints a personalized message welcoming the user to the program[cite: 11].

### Expected Output:
```text
Enter your first name: John
Enter your last name: Doe

Hello, John Doe! Welcome to the Python program.
