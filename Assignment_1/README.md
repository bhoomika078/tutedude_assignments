## Task 1: Perform Basic Mathematical Operations
This program takes two numbers as input and performs basic arithmetic.

### Features:
**User Input**: Takes two numbers from the user.
**Calculations**: Performs Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division.
**Results**: Displays the output of each operation on the screen.

### Expected Output:
```text
Enter the first number: 5
Enter the second number: 10

Addition: 15
Subtraction: -5
Multiplication: 50
Division: 0.5
```

## Task 2: Create a Personalized Greeting
This program is designed to create a custom greeting by processing user names.

### Features:
**User Input**: Takes the user's first name and last name as separate inputs.
**Concatenation**: Combines the first and last name into a single full name.
**Greeting**: Prints a personalized message welcoming the user to the program.

### Expected Output:
```text
Enter your first name: John
Enter your last name: Doe

Hello, John Doe! Welcome to the Python program.
