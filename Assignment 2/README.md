# Assignment 2: Control Structures in Python

This repository contains the solutions for **Module 3: Control Structures in Python**. The goal of this assignment is to demonstrate the use of conditional logic and iteration in Python.

## Task 1: Check if a Number is Even or Odd
This program takes an integer input from the user and checks whether the number is even or odd.

### Functionality:
**Input**: Takes an integer input from the user.
**Logic**: Uses an `if-else` statement to determine parity.
**Output**: Displays the result stating if the number is even or odd.

**Example Output:**
* `7 is an odd number.`
* `12 is an even number.`

## Task 2: Sum of Integers from 1 to 50
This program calculates the sum of all integers in the range from 1 to 50.

### Functionality:
**Iteration**: Uses a `for` loop to iterate over numbers from 1 to 50.
**Calculation**: Calculates the total sum of all integers in that range.
**Output**: Displays the final sum.

**Expected Output:**
* `The sum of numbers from 1 to 50 is: 1275`

## How to Run the Scripts
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed.
3. Run the scripts using the following commands:
   ```bash
   python task1_even_odd.py
   python task2_sum_loop.py
